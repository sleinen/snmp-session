  <h1>SNMP support for Perl 5 - Notes on Security</h1>
</div>

<p> On February 12, 2002, the Computer Emergency Response Team issued
<em><a
href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-03.html">CERT&trade;
Advisory CA-2002-03 Multiple Vulnerabilities in Many Implementations
of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</a></em>.  The <a
href="http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/index.html">OUSPG</a> at
the University of Oulu in Finland had written an SNMPv1 test suite
that uncovered difficulties in numerous SNMP implementations with
respect to improperly encoded SNMP PDUs (Protocol Data Units).
Possible effects of these vulnerabilities included program crashes as
well as remote exploitabilities. </p>

<h2> Why <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt>/<tt>BER.pm</tt> Users Shouldn't Be
Too Concerned </h2>

<p> My SNMP support for Perl 5 is written entirely in Perl.  When it
decodes BER-encoded SNMP PDUs, it parses them from left to right and
splits them into sub-items as it goes, usually using
<tt>substr()</tt> or <tt>unpack()</tt>. </p>
