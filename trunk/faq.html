<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt></h1>

<hr>

<h2> <a name="snmpv3"></a>When will MRTG/<tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt>
support SNMPv3? </h2>

<p> MRTG 2.13 and higher includes support for SNMPv3, using the
<tt>Net::SNMP</tt> library.  See the sections about <a
href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/doc/mrtg-reference.en.html#enablesnmpv3"><tt>EnableSnmpV3</tt></a>,
<a
href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/doc/mrtg-reference.en.html#target"><tt>Target</tt></a>,
and <a
href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/doc/mrtg-reference.en.html#snmpoptions"><tt>SnmpOptions</tt></a>,
in the MRTG Reference Manual. </p>

<p> <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt> only supports SNMPv1 and
(community-based) SNMPv2 ("SNMPv2c").  There are no plans to add
SNMPv3 support to <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt>.  I'd recommend looking at
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-SNMP/">Net::SNMP</a> instead,
which has been supporting SNMPv3 for quite a while.  <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-SNMP/">Net::SNMP</a> is also
written much cleaner than <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt>, and like
<tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt> doesn't require any external binaries.  Some
non-standard (crypto) Perl modules might be required to use SNMP's
security features, however. </p>

<p> A nice project would be to write a variant of
<tt>SNMP_util.pm</tt> that sits on top of <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-SNMP/">Net::SNMP</a> rather than
on top of <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt>.  Since <a
href="http://www.mrtg.org/">MRTG</a> uses the <tt>SNMP_util.pm</tt>
layer, that should make it work with SNMPv3. </p>

<p> However, since SNMPv3 doesn't have communities, MRTG's target
syntax would have to be changed to accomodate SNMPv3 targets.  The
current syntax of <samp>community{at}host[:options]</samp> would have
to be modified (I think it should be changed, rather than further
extended, because it already looks too ugly because of its multiple
extensions. </p>

<p> For the target syntax, one should probably look at the SNMP URI
syntax (<a
href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc4088.txt"><tt>RFC&nbsp;4088</tt></a>. </p>

<p> Anther issue with SNMPv3 is that it uses engine IDs, which are
usually "discovered" using a well-defined discovery mechanism.  It
would be good to cache discovered engine IDs somewhere, to avoid
repeating the discovery process for every round of MRTG.  If MRTG is
run from cron every five minutes, then such an engine ID cache should
be written to disk between runs.  I'm not sure whether Net::SNMP
already supports this.  If MRTG is run as a long-running "daemon"
process, making the cache persistent might not be necessary. </p>
