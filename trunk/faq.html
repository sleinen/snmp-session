<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt></h1>

<hr>

<h2> <a name="snmpv3"></a>When will <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt> support SNMPv3? </h2>

<pre>
&gt; 	I came to know from Mr. Tobias Oetikar, that you are working
&gt; on the SNMP library used in the MRTG. I would like to know, if there
&gt; is any work going on to support the SNMP V3 in the future releases
&gt; of MRTG. We would like to use the security features which SNMP V3
&gt; supports.
</pre>

<p> <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt> would have to be modified to understand
SNMPv3.  Personally I think this would be stretching the current code
too much, and that it would be better to start with a fresh code
base. </p>

<p> <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-SNMP/"><tt>Net::SNMP</tt></a> is
an alternative library that started out looking a lot like
<tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt>, but is written in a much cleaner way and it
already supports SNMPv3.  Like <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt>, it is
stand-alone in that it doesn't require an additional SNMP toolkit like
UCD-SNMP/Net-SNMP. </p>

<p> It might be a useful exercise to modify MRTG to use
<tt>Net::SNMP</tt> instead of my <tt>SNMP_Session.pm</tt> (and Mike
Mitchell's <tt>SNMP_util.pm</tt> which comes with it).  However, it
might require some work to do this in a compatible way. </p>

<pre>
&gt; Do we have any 3rd party tools which can be integrated
&gt; with MRTG for the SNMP V3 support ?
</pre>

<p> I often use <a
href="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/">Net-SNMP</a> (the former
UCD-SNMP) as a command-line tool to access router information using
SNMPv3.  I have my SNMPv3 USM credentials configured in my
<samp>${HOME}/.snmp/snmp.conf</samp> file, so I can simply call
<samp>snmptable ROUTERNAME TABLENAME</samp> without giving a
community/user name. </p>

<p> It used to be the case that MRTG allowed the usage of external
SNMP command-line tools, including the CMU ones, which later became
UCD-SNMP.  Maybe this code still works? </p>
