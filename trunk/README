                      SNMP support for Perl 5
                       -----------------------

             Author: Simon Leinen  <simon@lia.di.epfl.ch>

This archive contains Perl 5 modules SNMP_Session.pm and BER.pm,
which, when used together, provide rudimentary access to remote SNMP
(v1) agents.

The only SNMP operation currently supported is "get".  That means that
you can neither set values, nor read tables using these routines.
Hopefully I will get around to implementing these other operations one
day.

The basic usage of these routines works like this:

        require 'BER.pm';
        require 'SNMP_Session.pm';

        # Set $host to the name of the host whose SNMP agent you want
        # to talk to.  Set $community to the community name under
        # which you want to talk to the agent.  Set port to the UDP
        # port on which the agent listens (usually 161).

        $session = SNMP_Session::open ($host, $community, $port);

        # Set $oid1, $oid2... to the BER-encoded OIDs of the MIB
        # variables you want to get.

        if ($session->get_request_response ($oid1, $oid2, ...)) {
            $response = $session->{pdu_buffer};
            ($bindings) = $session->decode_get_response ($response);
        
            while ($bindings ne '') {
                ($binding,$bindings) = &BER::decode_sequence ($bindings);
                ($oid,$value) = &BER::decode_by_template ($binding, "%O%@");
                print $pretty_oids{$oid}," => ",
                      &BER::pretty_print ($value), "\n";
            }
        } else {
            die "No response from agent on $host";
        }
