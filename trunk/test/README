A collection of test scripts for the Perl SNMP code.

test.pl
	trivial application that reads some fixed variables from an
	agent.

set-test.pl
	application that tries to change the sysContact.0 variable and
	then changes it back to the original value.  Contributed by
	Matthew Trunnell <matter@dune.media.mit.edu>

walk-test.pl
	another trivial application that walks two columns in the
	interface table of RFC 1213.

walk-intf.pl
	a variant of walk-test.pl that walks several columns of the
	RFC 1213 interfaces table.

wwwtest
	example for a CGI script that allows SNMP read access to a
	specific set of devices over the Web.

asn1-test.pl
ber-test.pl
	a few regression tests for BER encoding.  If you get errors
	running these, I'd be very interested to hear about it!
