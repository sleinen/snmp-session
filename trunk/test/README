A collection of test scripts for the Perl SNMP code.

arp	sample application that lists the ipNetToMediaTable of a
	host.  Similar to the simple form of the Unix "arp" command.

test.pl
	trivial application that reads some fixed variables from an
	agent.

set-test.pl
	application that tries to change the sysContact.0 variable and
	then changes it back to the original value.  Contributed by
	Matthew Trunnell <matter@dune.media.mit.edu>

walk-test.pl
	another trivial application that walks two columns in the
	interface table of RFC 1213.

walk-intf.pl
	a variant of walk-test.pl that walks several columns of the
	RFC 1213 interfaces table.

wwwtest
	example for a CGI script that allows SNMP read access to a
	specific set of devices over the Web.

asn1-test.pl
ber-test.pl
	a few regression tests for BER encoding.  If you get errors
	running these, I'd be very interested to hear about it!

if-counters.pl (requires Curses.pm)
	displays a router's byte and packet counter development in
	real-time.  Demonstrates map_table_4 and a heuristic for
	maxRepetitions.

sun-ps
	list the process table of a remote system using the "sun" MIB
	implemented in Sun's Solstice Enterprise Agents.

trap-send
	send an SNMPv1 trap to a remote management station

trap-listener
	sit there and listen for SNMPv1 traps, which are decoded and
	written out in a readable form
